Report Lab 0:
	1) I learned how to use both Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs for coding in Java. I also learned about 
		Constructors, how to use Classes in Java, Methods, what JUnit testing is, and a good basis in how to 
		read a Java file. I also learned how to comment in Java and what a good comment is for each method.
		I didn’t actually learn how to make a JavaDoc because my JavaDoc created in Eclipse gave us that 
		unknown error, so I got permission to not include it and still get full points. Which thank you for that btw. 
	
	2) Screenshots are up on the GitHub with the corresponding titles to images

	3) Extensions: I got it working in IntelliJ (Screenshot for proof, actually prefer IntelliJ) and I am posting everything on GitHub

	4) Grading statement: I completed every part of this assignment as well as adding in a few extensions, so I feel I deserve full credit for this Lab.
		I’m also pretty happy that I managed to make it to the ICE for this one, or I would 	have been totally in the dark for what to do for the Lab
